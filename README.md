## **Branching**

The repository uses the `main` branch as the default branch. All pull requests will be merged into this branch after they are completed, at a **later step** when a common app will be built.
 
For developing new features, fixing bugs or adding new documentation, we could use a specified pattern (* stands for your branch name):
 
| Branch Pattern | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `exercise/*` | A task exercise |
| `feature/*` | New feature development |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fixes |
| `hotfix/*` | Bug fixes that need to be integrated directly (e.g. high-prio prod bug) |
| `test/*` | Development of additional test cases |
| `chore/* | When doing tasks that are not directly related to features/bugs |
| `docs/* | Documentation changes |
